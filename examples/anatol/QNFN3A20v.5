 1. Setup commands -
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   LABEL    Aegean-Anatolian topography from etopo1
#
#  when setting up a problem defined by a POLY file, use the GEOMETRY
#  command first to set NCOMP, IGRAV and CENTRELONG
#  If activating READ command beware unintended consequences
#  of other commands; advise comment out MESH, POLY, TOPO, DEFORM
#
#  READ     BIN=MODEL

   DEFORM   SPHERICAL
#  BCOND should be applied after DEFORM to get tractions right
#  in problems that use projection from the sphere

   2. Timestep commands
   ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   SOLVE    AC = 5.0E-6, ACNL = 5.0E-5, ITSTOP = 1000
   STEPSIZE TYPE=RK, IDT0=40
   SAVE     KSAVE=10, TSAVE=0.2
   STOP     KEXIT=0, TEXIT=2., IWRITE=200
  
   3. Boundary condition commands -
   ----------------------------------------------------
 The boundary segments on N and SE are fixed at zero velocity.
 The boundary segments on SE, and SW are set by BCONDMOD with
 tractions specified by the BCONDMOD TYPE=14 command.
 set tractions before velocities on overlap points.
