2D viscous flow code; Lagrangian frame
This package used to solve general 2D viscous flow problems in finite domain allowing for sptaially varying and /or non-Newtonian viscosity.
The program uses the finite element method and depends on the triangle package of Shewchuk to provide solutions for complex closed domains
with flexible boundary conditions on velocity or traction.
The program can provide solutions for plane-strain, thin viscous sheet (plane-stress), thin viscous shell, or axiymmetric cases.
