# bar -         [vertical/horizontal/none]
#               determines whether a colour bar appears and if it
#               will be vertical (on the right of the plot) or

# colour -      [greyscale/standard]
#               specifies a standard colourmap or greyscale map 
#               greyscale useful for output to b/w postscript printers

#                     0=FD.sols/solution_filename is saved to log files
# flip -        not implemented
# font_height - point height for default font [usually 10/12/14]
#               This font size will be used for automatic labels
# foreground -  [0->7] 0=white(ps)/black(screen) default background
#                      1=black(ps)/white(screen) default foreground

# label -       display default plot labels[0/1]
# linestyle -   [solid/dash/dot]. Applies to profile plots and marks,
#               arrows and xy-plots.
# linewidth -   [0.0->?] sets the width of all lines. (pixels or Post-
#               Script points (72/in)
# mark_cell -   [0/1] draw a dotted line around the current cell.
#               This option is ignored by Sybilps.
# mp   -        determines the number of arrows horizontally on an arrow plot
#               ie every mpth point in the x direction on the interpolation mesh
# mpe  -        controls the number of elements used in the mesh
#               deformation plots, ie if mpe=n then deformation is
#               calculated for every nth element
# np   -        determines the number of arrows vertically on an arrow plot
#               ie every npth point in the y direction on the interpolation mesh
# nx3  -        no. points (+2) in the x direction on the interpolation mesh
#               ny3 is calculated
# orientation - [LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT]
# page_scale -  not implemented
# page_xmargin- [0.0] margin on left and right sides of the page,
#               expressed as a fraction of the page width.
# page_ymargin- [0.0] margin on top and bottom of the page,
#               expressed as a fraction of the page height.
# profile_pts - no. points across interpolation mesh for profiles
# rescale -     [0/1] rescale the next cell plotted. Scale is unchanged
#               until another rescale= 1 is read.
# rows -        [1 -> 10]
# solution_rot -rotate x, y co-ords and velocity field 90deg x this
#                value (anti-clockwise)
# stipple -     [0/1/2/3/4]
#               0 no stippling
#               1 stipple below contour level
#               2 stipple above contour level
#               3 stipple if abs value above contour level
#               4 stipple if abs value below contour level
# text_bg -     [0/1] fill a background rectangle behind the text
# ticmarks -    [internal/external/centred/none] draw tickmarks on the
#               axes of profile plots
# verbose -     [0/1/2] output the interpolation grid or profile values
#               0 no output
#               1 write the values to text files with the parameter as the 
#                 filename extension (e.g. Sybil.Ux)
#               2 write the values to the screen
# xmargin -     [0.15] determines the margin on the left and right of the
#               plot. Value is entered as a fraction of the cell width.
# ymargin -     [0.1] determines the margin above and below the plot.
#               Value is entered as a fraction of the cell height.
